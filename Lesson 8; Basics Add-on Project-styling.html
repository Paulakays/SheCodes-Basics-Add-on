    <h1>Writing</h1>
    <h2>What is writing?</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Writing</b> is the act of creating a persistent representation of human language. Writing is a cognitive and social activity involving neuropsychological and physical processes.

        okay, okay, okay. I'm going to stop right there; we're not in a history class, we're talking about my hobby. Well, I do have other hobbies; I just chose to talk about one of them today which is writing.
        I started writing during the pandemic. I didn't actually take it serious because I thought that I was just trying; rather, passing time. It turned out to be enjoyable. 
        Imagine just pouring out your thoughts on a apiece of paper. I mean, not everyone does that because everyone has their own unique way they represent their writing. As for me; it's 
        always about my thoughts and feelings.
    </p>
        I feel at peace when I write my thoughts down. I get to feel all the emotions once again and actually perceive them fully; better than I may have, the moment they happened. I get to analyze everything.
        People tend to ask me what I write when I do tell them that writing is my hobby. I never know how to answer this question because I don't dwell on one genre, since I think of a lot of different stuff.
        I haven't really written a lot because I have a lot going on and with multiple hobbies it gets hard balancing all of them; but I do write any chance I get.As we are speaking, I've written two "articles" already; I just haven't posted them. 
        But I will very soon.
    <p>
        Here's what my thoughts look like;
